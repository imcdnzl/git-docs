# Using Visual Studio Code with Git

VSCode docs are [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) for working with version control, including Git.

You will need to install Git and also Git Credential Manager for Windows, to stop you getting errors of "Host key verification failed"

Alternatively you could try [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-online/) which was formerly known as Visual Studio Online. Please note that it isn't working straight off if you use git repo to clone, so suggest using https.
